# CS350




The project involved developing code for a microcontroller to control the blinking of green, yellow, and red LEDs in Morse code patterns. The system included a synchronous state machine that created these patterns, and a button press would trigger a change in the Morse code message. Additionally, the project required the initialization of a timer to drive the state machine, implementation of interrupts to detect button presses, and documentation of the state machine operation. The main problem addressed was achieving the expected functionality, encompassing both the state machine and button change, while adhering to coding best practices.

One aspect of the project that was executed particularly well was the implementation of coding best practices. The code was structured with clear formatting, well-commented sections, and logical organization, making it easily readable and maintainable. By adhering to these practices, it ensured that the codebase was not only functional but also accessible to others for collaboration or future modifications.

However, I can definitely improve when it comes to documentation. While the state machine functionality accurately reflected the technical specifications, I had failed to create a draw.io diagram. Creating one and having comprehensive comments and explanatory notes in the documentation would enhance its clarity, serving as a valuable resource for both developers and any future contributors.

In terms of support network, the tools and resources integrated into the project included draw.io for creating documentation, a timer for synchronization, and interrupts for button detection. These tools contribute to a robust support network for similar projects by providing a foundation for understanding and expanding upon the codebase.

In my opinion, the skills I acquired from this project, such as state machine design, timer initialization, and interrupt handling, are highly transferable to other projects and coursework. These skills form a solid foundation for working with embedded systems and microcontroller programming, which are widely applicable in various domains.
